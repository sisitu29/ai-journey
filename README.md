# AI Engineer Journey 🚀

Welcome to my 12-month journey to becoming an AI Model Engineer — from a software development background with deep networking exposure to full-stack AI!

## 👤 About Me
I’m currently an SDE2 at Amazon working on CloudFront, where my work involves heavy networking, Rust, and eBPF. With a strong math/physics background and a deep interest in AI, I’m documenting my transition into the world of machine learning and deep learning — with a focus on both **AI modeling** and **AI infrastructure**.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview
This roadmap is broken down into monthly stages. Each stage has:
- Core topics
- Tools/frameworks
- Mini-projects
- Datasets

See full detailed roadmap [here](../ai_engineer_roadmap).

## 🧠 Motivation
As a software developer with a strong networking background, I’ve always enjoyed building performance-sensitive and technically deep systems. But AI is reshaping the world, and I want to be part of that revolution — not just as a user, but as a builder.
